    1. If you don't have a semester break or a very short semester break, it means that some of your previous semesters were way too long. We will use this to our advantage.
    2. We will start the syllabus for the next semester and start doing PYQs and exercises from Clasical Text books like Rudin, Hoffman, Artin.
